            Uh-huh, look, I can see your face in the Parisian paintings <br>
            The Mona Lisa<br>
            I can hear your voice in the streets and the TV stations<br>
            And the police's<br>
            I can feel the strings on my wrist, I don't need these bracelets<br>
            Of all the things that she keeps in cages<br>
            Uh-huh, I'm her leastest favorite<br>
            Uh-huh, and she said<br>

            Love is when you try to place it out your mind (Uh-huh)<br>
            But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)<br>
            And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)<br>
            And love is when you try to make it out alive (Uh-huh)<br>
            But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)<br>
            And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)<br>
